### Project idea

I got the idea of this app by trying to find one really easy to use budget management app on my phone, the conclusion was simple: I cannot find an app on the PlayStore that fits my needs.

I want a simpler app to manage budget on Android. Only 1 account, no export-import features, no stats/graph, simple interface, quick and efficient.

I simply decided to create my own app in my free time, with the hope that I'm not the only one looking for an easiest way to manage my budget.
